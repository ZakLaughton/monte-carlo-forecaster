# monte-carlo-forecaster

Project Goal: A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) tool to automate probabilistic sprint planning.

Context: Moving away from time-based estimation toward historical velocity data can reduce sprint planning overhead. This prototype explores using a Monte Carlo simulation to visualize "percent likelihood" of delivery dates based on past throughput.

Tech Stack Experiments:
• Vite + React: Exploring lightweight build tooling for fast prototyping.
• Monte Carlo Logic: Client-side simulation of 10,000+ iterations.
• Visualization: Rendering statistical distribution using Recharts.
